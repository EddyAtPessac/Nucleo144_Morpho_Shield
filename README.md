# Nucleo144 Morpho shield template

This template is taken from the CRVA project: https://github.com/cvra/nucleo144-shield
It's contains only the ST morpho connectors on the schematic and on the PCB.
It contains the Morpho connector as well as holes for the passage of Arduino connectors. 
Like this, it is possible to place this shield above the Nucleo board, and add an Arduino shield on top. 
The pads of the arduino connectors are only on the bottom side to facilitate the passage of the tracks between them.
 

## Requirements list


* Mechanical dimension
  - Width and length, max same as Nucleo-144 board (70mmx108mm)
  - Maximum mechanical available space including output cable for Nucleo board and shield ( height = 36mm, lenght = 136.5mm)
